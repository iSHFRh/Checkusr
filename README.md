# OSINT: social media check username

Hunt Down Open-Source Intelligence Using Social Media Accounts by Usernames.

This tool is a Python OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence Tool) for finding information on people that you do not know, but have only a social media/site username of the target.

Then once you get a hit for that username on other social media sites/sites, you can then look for more information through their posts, data, pictures, etc that may give away more info on their IRL location, name, etc. As people tend to use the same username for every site/social media site they use.

this tool is a way to get that data.
